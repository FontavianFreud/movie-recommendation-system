# Movie Recommendation System (Mini-Project 1)

This project is the first stage of a larger Movie Recommendation System built to explore data science and machine learning techniques for personalized recommendations.

Mini-Project 1 focuses on:
- Data ingestion and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Building non-ML recommendation baselines

The goal of this stage is to understand the dataset, identify its challenges, and establish strong baselines before applying machine learning models in later stages.

Setup

1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system

2. Create a virtual environment: 

python -m venv .venv

3. Activate the virtual environment(Windows):

.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

You should see (.venv) at the start of your terminal prompt after this step.

4. Install Dependencies: 

pip install -r requirements.txt



Data:

This project uses the MovieLens 100k dataset.

Download Instructions: 

1. Download the MovieLens 100K dataset
2. Unzip the downloaded file
3. Place the extracted ml-100k folder into

data/raw/ml-100k/

This directory should contain files such as:

u.data
u.item
u.user
u.genre

Note: Raw data is intentially excluded from GitHub and must be downloaded manually. 


Running the Project:

1. Clean and preprocess the data

python src/clean_data.py

This script should:

- load raw MovieLens data
- cleand and standardize columns
- merge ratings with movie titles
- output a processed dataset to:

data/processed/ratings_with_titles.csv


2. Run baseline recommendation models

Global top-rated movies baseline

python src/baseline_recs.py

This will produce a list of top-rated movies after applying a minimum rating threshold. 

Similar-movies (co-occurrence) baseline

python src/similar_movies.py

This recommends movies frequently liked by users who liked a given seed movie. 



Mini Project 2: 

Project Overview

This project implements and evaluates multiple movie recommendation approaches using the MovieLens 100K dataset. The goal is to understand how different recommendation objectives and evaluation strategies affect real-world top-K recommendation quality.

Starting from exploratory data analysis and simple baselines, the project progresses through explicit-feedback matrix factorization (rating prediction) and culminates in an implicit-feedback, pairwise ranking model optimized directly for recommendation quality.

The project emphasizes correct evaluation, baseline comparisons, and alignment between training objectives and ranking metrics.

Data & Exploratory Analysis

The MovieLens 100K dataset consists of ~100,000 user–movie ratings on a 1–5 scale.

Key findings from EDA:

The user–item interaction matrix is ~94% sparse

Most users rate a limited number of movies (median ≈ 65)

Most movies receive relatively few ratings (long-tail distribution)

Simple global popularity is therefore a strong baseline

These properties motivate the use of collaborative filtering and careful evaluation design.

Evaluation Setup

To ensure realistic recommendation evaluation:

Time-aware split: for each user, the last 5 interactions are held out as test data

Relevant items: movies rated ≥ 4 in the test set

Candidate sampling: evaluation ranks items among:

all relevant test items

200 randomly sampled unseen negatives per user

Metrics:

Precision@10

Recall@10

All evaluation is performed using training data only for model fitting to avoid data leakage. Random seeds are fixed for reproducibility.

Models Implemented
1. Popularity Baseline

Recommends globally popular movies based on average rating, with a minimum rating-count threshold.

2. Explicit Matrix Factorization (RMSE)

A classic collaborative filtering model trained via stochastic gradient descent to minimize squared rating error:

min
⁡
(
𝑟
𝑢
𝑖
−
𝑟
^
𝑢
𝑖
)
2
min(r
ui
	​

−
r
^
ui
	​

)
2

While effective at rating prediction, this objective is not directly aligned with top-K recommendation quality.

3. Implicit Matrix Factorization (BPR)

An implicit-feedback, pairwise ranking model trained to ensure that movies a user liked are ranked above movies they did not interact with.

This model optimizes ranking, not rating accuracy, and is better suited to sparse recommendation settings.

Results

All models were evaluated on the same users and candidate sets.

Model	Users	Precision@10	Recall@10
Popularity	820	0.0676	0.1987
MF (RMSE)	820	0.0618	0.1828
BPR (implicit)	820	0.1544	0.4985

Key observations:

Explicit MF significantly reduced training RMSE but underperformed the popularity baseline on ranking metrics

Implicit MF (BPR) more than doubled Precision@10 and Recall@10 compared to popularity

Aligning the training objective with ranking metrics is critical for recommender performance

Key Lessons Learned

Strong baselines are hard to beat in sparse recommendation settings

Lower RMSE does not guarantee better recommendations

Evaluation design (time splits, candidate sampling) strongly affects conclusions

Implicit-feedback objectives are often better suited for top-K recommendation tasks than explicit rating prediction
