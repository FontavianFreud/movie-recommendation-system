# Movie Recommendation System (Mini-Project 1)

This project is the first stage of a larger Movie Recommendation System built to explore data science and machine learning techniques for personalized recommendations.

Mini-Project 1 focuses on:
- Data ingestion and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Building non-ML recommendation baselines

The goal of this stage is to understand the dataset, identify its challenges, and establish strong baselines before applying machine learning models in later stages.

Setup

1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system

2. Create a virtual environment: 

python -m venv .venv

3. Activate the virtual environment(Windows):

.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

You should see (.venv) at the start of your terminal prompt after this step.

4. Install Dependencies: 

pip install -r requirements.txt



Data:

This project uses the MovieLens 100k dataset.

Download Instructions: 

1. Download the MovieLens 100K dataset
2. Unzip the downloaded file
3. Place the extracted ml-100k folder into

data/raw/ml-100k/

This directory should contain files such as:

u.data
u.item
u.user
u.genre

Note: Raw data is intentially excluded from GitHub and must be downloaded manually. 


Running the Project:

1. Clean and preprocess the data

python src/clean_data.py

This script should:

- load raw MovieLens data
- cleand and standardize columns
- merge ratings with movie titles
- output a processed dataset to:

data/processed/ratings_with_titles.csv


2. Run baseline recommendation models

Global top-rated movies baseline

python src/baseline_recs.py

This will produce a list of top-rated movies after applying a minimum rating threshold. 

Similar-movies (co-occurrence) baseline

python src/similar_movies.py

This recommends movies frequently liked by users who liked a given seed movie.
